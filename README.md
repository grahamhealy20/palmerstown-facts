# palmerstown-facts
A **very** serious Flask application which emits facts about Palmerstown!

## What it does
It simply scrapes Wikipedia for facts about [Palmerstown (my home town)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmerstown) and returns one as JSON.

## Why?
So I can prove to people that [**Palmerstown does in-fact have a W in the name!**](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/palmerstown-wins-back-w-as-council-approves-name-change-1.2064799) Also to serve as a data-point to help when learning about Bots on [Amazon Echo](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit) and [Google Assistant](https://developers.google.com/actions/).
